# NollyStream Frontend

## üé¨ Project Overview

Welcome to **NollyStream**, a modern, responsive, and intuitive frontend for a fictional Nollywood (Nigerian Cinema) streaming platform.

* **Accessibility (A11y) Focused:** Implemented with semantic HTML5, appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`), and sufficient color contrast to ensure a broad audience can interact with the site.
* **Clean & Maintainable Code:** Written with best practices for HTML structure, CSS organization (using variables, comments, and BEM-like naming conventions where applicable), and modular JavaScript.
